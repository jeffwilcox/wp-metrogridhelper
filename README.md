==================

A great runtime design tool for Windows Phone developers, overlays a grid to help with alignment and design.

# Windows Phone 7.0-7.8

This library works great for these platforms where the grid is essentially based on the number 12.

# Windows Phone 8.0

The phone 8.0 SDK includes a graphic in the default project templates; this "alignment grid" is essentially the same feature.

# Windows Phone 8.1

In the 8.1 OS release the magic numbers change, being 80% of the original value. This library is not designed for or compatible with this system at this time.
